# Drawing Polygons

Your goal is to write a program where a user can choose a number of sides, and your turtle will draw a regular polygon with that many sides.

Recommended steps:
1. Write code to draw a triangle, a square, and a pentagon
2. If you didn't use a loop the first time, update the code for your shapes to use a loop instead drawing each line individually
3. Do you notice any patterns across the code for your 3 shapes? Instead of duplicating that code, can you come up with a function that you could use to draw all three shapes?
4. Add user input. Allow the user to choose a number of sides, and then draw a shape with that many sides.

Extensions:
* Allow user to choose colors
* Allow user to choose side lengths
* Draw stars instead of polygons
* Propose your own extensions!
