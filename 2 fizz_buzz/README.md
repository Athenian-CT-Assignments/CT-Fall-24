# FizzBuzz

Your goal is to print out a series of numbers, but you will replace some with Fizz and others with Buzz. 

1. Ask the user for 2 numbers.  
2. Use a loop to step through the numbers 1-100
3. If the number is a multiple of the first user-chosen number, print Fizz. If it is a multiple of the 2nd user-chosen number, print Buzz. If it is a multiple of both, print FizzBuzz. Otherwise, print the loop number.


Example:
```
first number: 3
second number: 4
Partial output:
1
2
Fizz
Buzz
5
Fizz
7
Buzz
Fizz
10
11
FizzBuzz
```
