# Guess a Number

Your task is to create a guessing game that asks the user to guess a number between 1 and 10.
* Some starter code is provided to choose the random number

### Steps to take (and where to go for review)

#### Day 1
* Take in user input that’s a number
  * 8.2: Input & output
* Store the input in a variable
  * 8.3: Variables
* Print the input back to the user
  * 8.2: Input & output
* Print double the input back to the user. Does it work? If yes, comment out this line or delete it. (The point is to make sure everything is working up to here.)
  * If it doesn’t look right, you may want to review the page on 8.6 Data Types!
  * 8.4 Arithmetic expressions, 8.6 Data types
* If the number is 5, tell them “you win!” Otherwise, tell them “you lose!”
  * 8.7 Booleans & Conditionals
* Store a random number from 1-10 in a variable at the start of the program.
* Instead of checking if their number is 5, check if their number is the random number
* Let the user make 3 guesses before they lose

#### Day 2
* If you didn’t already, avoid duplicating any code. Can you use a loop and allow 5 guesses instead of 3? 
  * 8.8 Loops (for)
* Break out of the loop when the user makes a correct guess
  * 8.8 Loops (for)
* If they guess wrong, tell them whether their guess was too low or too high
  * 8.7 Booleans & Conditionals
* If the guess was their 5th one and is wrong, tell them they lost
  * 8.7 Booleans & Conditionals
* Give an option to play again at the end
  * 8.8 Loops (while)
