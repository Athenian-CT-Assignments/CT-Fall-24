# MadLibs instructions
For this assignment, you will create a Mad Libs-type story. 

1. Start by writing a short story (3-5 sentences).
2. Select some words that you want to replace with user-entered words. For example, you might choose to replace names, locations, descriptions, etc.
3. Use `input` statements to gather user input for those words. Pay close attention to your prompts so the user's words fit into your story.
4. Using f-strings, insert the user's words into your story and print it. Pay attention to formatting. Use `\n` to go to a new line and minimize scrolling sideways.
5. Test your program with a neighbor.
6. Submit your program on Canvas.
