# Computational Thinking Final Project

## Overview
For your final project, you will spend our remaining time together working on the project of your choice and demonstrating the skills you've learned over the course of this semester (especially decomposition, abstraction, pattern recognition and algorithm design).

## Project timeline

### Plan your Project 
* Choose a topic
* Decide on features
* Plan it out! (decomp/flowcharts)
  * Flow chart from user perspective (on paper)
  * Big ideas and tasks (on paper)
  * Flow chart of logic (on paper)
* Make a timeline/choose milestones so you know you are on track

### Work on project
* Start building your project
* Be sure to refer back to your plan and timeline often
* Make sure you test your code often! It's much easier to debug throughout the process rather than waiting until the end!

### Troubleshooting
* Allow time for troubleshooting/debugging
* Have your friends test your program (look for edge cases!)

### Finishing touches
* Update your flow charts to be sure they reflect the current version of your project
* Double-check that you've met all of the project requirements
* Present your project to the class!
* Complete your reflection

## Resources & Ideas
You can build anything that will take two weeks and demonstrate the necessary skills, but here are a few options to get you started:
* Design a game or tool that is interesting to you
  * You may have a physical component, too - see the game boards on the wall as examples.
* Build an interactive application with Python Turtle
* Come up with your own idea. Just be sure to get it approved first!
